## Info
An NFT where nothing can be changed, the URI is revealed after a time period and the owner can't change the price, or the URI. This is done to adhere to the principles of decentralisation and autonomity. If in the unfortunate case where the URI becomes deprecated, the owner of this contract does not lay fault as this contract was made with all the intentions of being decentralised.
